# CV-FinalProject-MaskDetector
 
## Step 1 
Contains the code for making the synthetic dataset

## Step 2 
Contains the code for training/implementing the DL models and class CV detection methods. 

## Step 3 
Contains the code for evaluating the performance of the DL models on the test set, on multi-person images, and on videos. 

## Step 4
Contains the code for running the mask detector in real-time using the mask detection trained MobileNetv2. It is the only code within the repo that is designed to be implementable on most systems with the dependencies installed. The list of the dependencies and how to use the real-time detection algorithm are in the folder.
